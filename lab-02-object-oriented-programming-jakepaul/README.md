    ###1.	Separating implementation from interfaces allows someone who is writing code to create several implementations of an interface of the same interface, avoiding a lot of repetition.
            It also helps you fix small things in your program and make small improvements without having to change the rest of the code.
            Implementations are ‘private-packaged’ because the only way you can access a member is with its own package or by a subclass of its class in another package.
       2.	An issue encountered in the implementations was making sure the different classes interacted with each other when needed.
            For example, making sure that at when you are adding a student into a course, you are simultaneously enrolling the student in that course.
       3.	Yes, when testing I found lots of implementation errors.
